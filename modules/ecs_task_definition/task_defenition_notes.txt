rom all this information, I can see several critical issues:

The service deployment has failed with the message "tasks failed to start"
You have an Application Load Balancer (ALB) configured but no targets are registered
The tasks are continuously getting stuck in "Provisioning" state

Let's check some specific things:

First, check if your container instance is actually registered with the cluster:

bashCopyaws ecs list-container-instances --cluster demo-cluster-dae98b60

Check your task definition. Run:

bashCopyaws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition nginx-task-dae98b60:1

Check ECS agent connectivity to the cluster:

bashCopysudo docker logs ecs-agent | grep -i cluster

Check if your security groups are properly configured:


The ALB security group should allow inbound traffic on port 80
The EC2 instance security group should allow inbound traffic from the ALB security group
The EC2 instance security group should allow outbound traffic to pull Docker images

Key points to verify:

Does your task definition include:

The correct port mappings for nginx (port 80)
The correct network mode (should be "bridge" since that's what we see in your EC2)
Proper healthcheck configuration


Does your service configuration include:

The correct target group
The correct container name and port in the load balancer configuration



Could you please run the commands above and also check:

The task definition details from AWS console (ECS → Task Definitions → nginx-task-dae98b60:1)
The security group configurations for both the ALB and EC2 instance

Based on the symptoms, I suspect one of these issues:

The container instance isn't properly registered with the cluster
The task definition has incorrect port mappings or network configuration
Security group rules are preventing proper communication between ALB and containers
The ECS agent doesn't have proper permissions to register tasks
